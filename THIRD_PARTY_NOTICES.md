# Third-Party Notices

Draft to Take beta is an application layer around third-party local AI models and runtime dependencies. This file is not legal advice. Re-check official upstream sources before relying on model outputs for public or commercial use.

The launcher, docs, and helper scripts in this public beta repository are MIT licensed. That MIT license does not relicense Draft to Take container images, private source code, third-party model weights, third-party runtimes, or generated model outputs.

Draft to Take does not claim ownership of user-created scripts, projects, voice samples, source clips, generated audio, SFX, ambience, music, or exported mixes. However, Draft to Take cannot grant rights it does not own. Users remain responsible for input rights, voice consent, impersonation/publicity/privacy rules, and the license terms of any third-party model or runtime they use.

## IndexTTS2

Draft to Take uses the official IndexTTS2 model/runtime family for dialogue generation.

Official sources:

- Code: https://github.com/index-tts/index-tts
- Model: https://huggingface.co/IndexTeam/IndexTTS-2
- Model license: https://huggingface.co/IndexTeam/IndexTTS-2/blob/main/LICENSE.txt

Draft to Take does not bundle IndexTTS2 model weights in this release repo. The app may download model files into your local shared model folder on first run.

## Qwen / Script LLM

The beta can run an optional managed local Qwen GGUF sidecar for emotion detection and AI Thread workflows.

Default model source:

- https://huggingface.co/ufoym/Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M-GGUF

## OmniVoice

The beta can run an optional OmniVoice sidecar for reusable voice design.

Official source:

- https://huggingface.co/k2-fsa/OmniVoice
- https://github.com/k2-fsa/OmniVoice

Users remain responsible for lawful, authorized use of generated or cloned voices.

## SFX And Music Models

The optional SFX/music sidecar can be enabled by the beta launcher when Docker GPU support is available, and can be disabled with `INDTEXTS_SFX_ENABLED=false`.

Possible model sources:

- Woosh sound effects: https://github.com/SonyResearch/Woosh
- Woosh checkpoint mirror used by the sidecar default: https://huggingface.co/AEmotionStudio/woosh-models
- MusicGen music beds: https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-small

Woosh and MusicGen model-backed generation should be treated as experimental and license-dependent unless the active model/backend terms have been checked and are clearly suitable for your intended use.

Draft to Take should not be treated as granting extra rights to third-party models or their outputs.

## User Data

Do not upload private scripts, speaker samples, source clips, generated private scenes, tokens, or model weights to public issue reports.
